# Reading 4

- Evan M. Peck, et al., 2019, Attitudes and Perceptions of Data Visualization <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ucsd.cogs9/readings/r4a_Viz_in_PA.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download &#x2197;</a>
- Hadley Wickham, et al., 2010, Graphical Inference for Infovis <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ucsd.cogs9/readings/r4b_graphical_inference_wickham.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download &#x2197;</a>

Reading 4 focuses on what you can do with data visualizations (not just how to make them look nice.) In class, we spend a lot of time on using basic visuals effectively, communicating with data, and recognizing common (and inefficient) visualization choices. 

Wickham’s paper introduces a more advanced idea: visualizations aren’t only for presenting results—they can be powerful tools for analysis and discovery, helping you think through a dataset and uncover structure you might miss otherwise. 

Peck’s paper shifts to data visualization literacy: how people interpret charts, what they notice (or miss), and what design choices help audiences understand the message. A key takeaway is that people often need visuals that reduce cognitive load: clarity and simplicity matter!

  - This reading guide highlights the major ideas to focus on in the paper. **You will not turn in the guide**—it’s simply here to help you distill the paper and keep track of the main points. Use it before you read (to preview what to look for), while you read (to take notes), and after you read (to review). It will also be a helpful reference when preparing for the reading quiz/exam!
