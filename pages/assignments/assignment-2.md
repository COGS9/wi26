<h2>Frequently Asked Questions - FAQ</h2>

1. How many parameters are required to find the p-values?
>You may use any combination of settings as long as your final result has p<0.05. Just make sure you record your choices clearly and completely so someone else could reproduce your result (i.e., all variables, options/checkboxes, method, and any filters you used).

2. How detailed does oue justification need to be when picking our first set of variables?
>Not very detailed—this isn’t a political science course. You just need a brief, reasonable justification for why you chose those variables. If you’re less familiar with U.S. politics or economic indicators, that’s okay. We don’t expect your justification to be “correct,” and we don’t need to agree with it—but do your best to make it logical and consistent with your hypothesis.
