<h2>Frequently Asked Questions - FAQ</h2>

1. How to find the number of unique words a singer used for part I?
> You can hover over the profile picture of the singer on the scatter plot, and the number would show up. And if you want to select a singer by their name, go to the top-left corner and find a dropdown list there. Select the name of the singer you are interested in.
2. What kind of plots should we use for our data points?
> Try to look back at the data visualization lecture slides and think about what kind of variables you’re working with. One example is if you have two or more categories that you want to represent the count for, a barplot may be the best way to visualize your data.
3. For the scatterplots, do we need to show a best fit line or any other expectations?
> No, for the scatterplots on this assignment, make sure you have a clear title and labeled axis. And make sure the data points are spread evenly across. We only want to see the trend of the data points, so no lines or additional modeling is required. But feel free to add it if it helps you.
