# Group Project

For your Group Project, you will explore and synthesize the data science approaches you’re learning this quarter. Your task is to propose a project that tackles a novel question that can be answered with data, and to describe how you would integrate multiple data science methods and ideas to address it. Write as if you already had full command of data science—data collection, data mining, wrangling, programming, statistical reasoning, and analysis—and focus on clearly outlining your question, hypothesis, overall approach, planned analyses, and expected conclusions.

Your question can be:

* Scientific (e.g., “How do different cultures perceive different colors?”)
* Just plain interesting (e.g., “What are commonly misheard song lyrics?”)
* Statistical/methodological (e.g., “How large do crowds need to be to produce reliable estimates for different types of questions?”)

Your project must include the following sections:

1. Question
2. Hypothesis
3. Background Information
4. Data
5. Ethical Considerations
6. Analysis Proposal
7. Discussion
8. Group Participation

Write with clarity and precision. Proofread carefully, avoid flowery or vague language, and aim for concise writing—use as many words as necessary, but no more. A portion of your grade will reflect the quality of your writing: clear, logical, and free of avoidable errors, as well as your ability to follow the instructions in this document.

**Submission:** Your group will submit one PDF for Checkpoints 1 and 2, and one final video presentation to Gradescope by the posted deadlines. Late submissions are not accepted unless circumstances outside your control arise. If that happens, email your section TAs/PLAs and your teammates before the deadline!
