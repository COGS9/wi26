<h1>Exams</h1>

There will be **two, non-cumulative exams** in this class (please mark them in your calendar!): 
* **Tuesday, Jan 27**
  * (Webclicker questions for studying)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SbXMjekmnXvSxeEnfIk0nwslhuB0laKI/view]
* **Tuesday, Mar 6**
  * (Study sheets + webclicker questions)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TcIWG3w7h4Bd5SsI87a_fcpxk1wKbuiO/view?usp=drive_link]

Each exam will be roughly 50-60 multiple-choice questions, and will cover material from both the lecture and readings. The TAs & PLAs will hold exam review sessions before each exam.

## What happens if I miss an exam or have testing accommodations? 
We will use the [Triton Testing Center (TTC)](https://tritontesting.ucsd.edu/) located in Pepper Canyon Hall 364 to administer exams for students with documented accommodations and for legitimate excused absences (does NOT include voluntary travel).

If you know you need to miss an exam for a legitimate, unavoidable conflict, please let **Prof. Lai** know ASAP. You may schedule your make-up exam **within a 1-week window** after the initial exam date.
