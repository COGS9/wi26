<h1>Group Project Checkpoint - Part 1</h1>

- Checkpoint 1 Google Doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qIw-vE9MVFrf5ECPiZ1E-aHOkvI5FtJmJUFfEDj_rF0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download &#x2197;</a>
  - You cannot edit this document directly. Instead, **make a copy** in your own Google Drive and share edit access with all group members. Your group should do all of its work in that copied document. When you’re ready to submit, export the document as a PDF and upload one group submission to Gradescope. You may resubmit as many times as you like before the deadline.
-  Project groups survey form (EVERYONE must fill this out!) <a href=" " target="_blank" rel="noopener">coming soon! &#x2197;</a>

{: .warning }
Please do **NOT** submit multiple files on Gradescope. Each group should submit **one PDF total**, with all group members’ names and PIDs included in the document.

<h2>Forming Groups</h2>

You will have **two options** for forming a project group of 3-4 students:
1. You may choose your own group—we highly, highly recommend choosing students who are in **the same discussion section** as you (meaning those who are regularly attending that section), so that you can use section time to meet and touch base about the project. If you want to form group with friends outside of your section, **please ensure** that you are able to meet regularly with them. This is _your_ responsibility!
2. You may also choose to be assigned a group by us. We will send out a form at the **beginning of Week 3 (due at end of Week 3)** asking you about your topical interests and preferences for group dynamics, and the PLAs will carefully match groups based on your preferences! This can be a great way to meet new people with similar interests and take the stress off of group-finding. These groups will be formed within the section **that you are able to regularly attend**.

{: .important }
**Project groups will be finalized by Monday of Week 4** and Project Checkpoint #1 is **due Monday of Week 5**. 

If you are not in a group by Monday of Week 4, you must reach out to your TA/PLA ASAP! Also reach out to your TA/PLA early if there are any issues with group members dropping. Sometimes a group member will not tell their group they dropped the class and just go into silent mode. If you are unsure, ask your TA and they can verify the student’s status. In any case, it’s best to move forward with the members who are responsive, since repeatedly waiting on an unresponsive teammate is unlikely to be productive.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions - FAQ</h2>

 1. How specific does our data science question need to be?
 > Not very specific at this point. Good data science questions usually start broad and become more precise as you explore data, learn constraints, and (when possible) consult domain experts or stakeholders. The final project is a great place to take your Assignment 1 question and refine it. For now, focus on a topic your group finds interesting and propose a reasonable question based on the limited information you have.

 2. Do we need to find actual data that fits our question?
 > No, you do not. In fact, most teams won’t find a dataset that contains everything needed for an ideal analysis—and that’s fine! What we are looking for is that you looked for a data set that is _close enough_ to your topic/question.  If it has missing variables or limited observations, that's ok! You can still use the data—just let us know what or how much is missing. **For example:** you want to study the relationship between height and GPA, but your dataset doesn’t include GPA, but it *does* include average test scores. This is ok, just let us know what data you _wish_ you had.
 
 3. How much background info do we need?
 > Enough to justify your question and hypothesis logically. You don’t need to be a domain expert (and you may not be able to find one), but you should show clear reasoning: why is your hypothesis plausible, what assumptions are you making, and what background reading or evidence supports your framing? Briefly explain how you arrived at your decisions.
