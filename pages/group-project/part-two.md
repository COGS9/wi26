<h1>Group Project Checkpoint - Part 2</h1>

- Checkpoint 2 Google Doc <a href=" " target="_blank" rel="noopener">coming soon! &#x2197;</a>
  - You cannot edit this document directly. Instead, make a copy in your own Google Drive and share edit access with all group members. Your group should do all of its work in that copied document. When you’re ready to submit, export the document as a PDF and upload one group submission to Gradescope. You may resubmit as many times as you like before the deadline.

{: .warning }
Please do NOT submit multiple files on Gradescope. Each group should submit one PDF total, with all group members’ names and PIDs included in the document.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

The first five sections of Checkpoint 2 are the same as those in Checkpoint 1. You should copy and paste the relevant sections from your earlier submission into this document, replacing the placeholders as needed. Be sure to incorporate any feedback you received from the instructional staff on Assignment 1, and update the content using what you’ve learned in the second half of the course.

It’s fine if these sections remain largely unchanged if you believe they are already strong. However, you should revisit them with a more critical eye. By this point in the course, we expect clearer writing, tighter logic, and more refined thinking—for example, you may need to sharpen your data science question so that it supports a well-defined analysis.

{: .note }
You may completely change your project direction from Checkpoint 1 if your group decides to do so. No prior approval is required.

After revising the first five sections, replace the text “ADD YOUR GROUP’S TEXT HERE AND DELETE INSTRUCTIONS ABOVE” with your group’s responses for the remaining sections, and delete the grey instructional text in the following sections:
- Analysis Proposal
- Discussion
- Group Participation

For each of these sections, carefully read the instructions provided in the document and replace them with your group’s content.

When finished, **save the document as a PDF and submit it to Gradescope.** Be sure to add all group members to the Gradescope submission.

**Important:** Individual grades depend on contribution—if you do not contribute, you will not receive credit for the project! **Please make sure everyone on your team has an assigned responsibility.**

{: .warning }
There are no late submissions accepted, unless there is an issue outside of your control. If so, email your course instructors and all your teammates **before** the due date.
