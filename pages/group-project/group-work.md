# Advice for Group Projects

Group projects can be challenging. Getting multiple people aligned and working toward a shared goal requires clear communication and structure. The guidance below reflects best practices for group work:

1. **Designate a team leader.** This person may do slightly less hands-on writing, but plays a critical role in coordinating the project: organizing the document, clarifying requirements, tracking progress, and ensuring the final report has a single, consistent voice.
2. **Choose one communication channel.** Pick a platform everyone agrees to use and will check regularly (email, Discord, WhatsApp, LINE, etc.). The specific tool doesn’t matter—consistency does. For student projects, I recommend Discord.
3. **Assign clear responsibilities.** Every team member should have a defined task, and each task should have a backup person in case someone gets sick, drops the class, or needs help completing their work (e.g., the ethics section).
4. **Start early on drafts.** Initial drafts should be added to the shared document at least 3–4 days before the deadline. This allows time for revision, proofreading, and integrating sections into a cohesive final product.
5. **Distribute proofreading.** Assign each person a section they did not write to proofread. This improves clarity and catches errors.
6. **Communicate early and often.** If you’re stuck, confused, or dealing with an issue, let your team know as soon as possible. Waiting until the last day increases stress and workload for everyone. Problems are normal; lack of communication is not.
7. **Meet before dividing work.** Start with an initial group meeting to discuss the requirements, brainstorm ideas, and confirm shared understanding. A useful technique is to ask team members to restate the plan in their own words—this helps uncover misunderstandings early, before they grow into larger problems.
8. **Meet regularly and take notes.** Don’t postpone meetings until everyone is available. Meet anyway, assign someone to take notes, and share meeting minutes afterward (via email or a shared folder). This keeps everyone informed, especially those who can’t attend.

I hope this helps set your group up for a smooth and successful collaboration!
