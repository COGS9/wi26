<h1>Assignments</h1>

Assignments 1, 2, and 3 are completed individually and are designed to reinforce concepts from lecture. When writing your responses, prioritize clarity and brevity over length—most questions should be answerable in one well-written paragraph.

⚠️ **AI Policy Reminder:** I encourage the use of AI to brainstorm ideas or clarify concepts introduced in lecture. However, copying AI-generated output verbatim and submitting it as your own work is **strictly prohibited.**  Not only is this usually easy to spot, but it also undermines your opportunity to learn. If we notice any obvious instances, you will receive a 0 on the assignment.
